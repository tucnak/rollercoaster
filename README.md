# A Programming Rollercoaster
>Introduction to software engineering. Written by a student, with students in mind.

I was having an outstanding meal that day: some beef steak with greenish Tabasco sauce and some sort of a pepsi drink. I generally enjoy spicy meals, but that particular one was a little bit tough. Usually, you might want to extinguish all the hell going on in your mouth with some cold pepsi. Well, that's a tricky one: once you drink too much of it, it burns much harder. Unfortunately, this story doesn't make any sense in the context of the book at all. I was thinking about my background project, which, at that time, I'd already been developing for a couple of weeks. At that moment of time I realized that idea behind ain't that good, at least ain't as good as I had thought at first.

Computer programming, or you may say, software engineering, is all about learning. Take a glance at other industries; for instance, in sewing, tailors are using the same good old techniques, which has been around here for centuries already. World of software engineering is whole different. Computers do keep on getting faster and faster, new technologies get born like everyday. Since you don't typically want to miss a new trend, you are expected to learn forever. Period. I am particularly interested in the first iteration of this endless loop.

There are two major kind of books: these aimed on teaching pure coding in some programming language and these covering theoretical knowledge. The first kind, in my humble opinion, is absolutely useless, since they don't teach programming, but monkey coding, which is rubbish. The second type of "programming" books usually covers a narrow range of academic knowledge, so it obviously doesn't make any sense for newcomers.

What I'm trying to do here is to build a unique resource: a book, supposed to teach you neither coding, nor algorithms, but the general thinking approach, which I personally find an absolute necessity in software engineering. I call it an idiomatic approach to software engineering.
