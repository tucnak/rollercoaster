# A Programming Rollercoaster
>Introduction to software engineering. Written by student, with students in mind.


Once I was having an outstanding meal: some beef steak with greenish Tabasco sauce and some sort of pepsi drink. I generally enjoy spicey meals, but that particular one was a little bit.. tough. Usually, you might want to extinguish all the hell going on in your mouth with some cold pepsi. Well, that's a tricky one: once you drink too much of it, it burns even harder. Unfortunately, this doesn't make any real sense in the context of the book. In the meantime, I was thinking about my background project, which, at that time, I've been already developing for a few weeks. At that moment of time I realized that idea behind ain't that good, at least ain't as good as I thought at first.

Computer programming, or its trendy synonym, software engineering, is all about learning. Take a glance at other industries: for instance, in sewing, tailors are using the same old good techniques, which has been around here for centuries. Software development world is whole different. Computers do keep on getting faster and faster, new technologies get born like everyday. Since you don't typically want to miss a new trend, you are expected to learn forever. Period. I am particularly interested in first iteration of this endless loop.

There are two major kinds of books: these, aimed on teaching pure coding in some programming language and these covering theoretical knowledge. Th first sort of books, in my humble opinion, are dumb as shit and absolutely useless, since they don't teach programming, but monkey coding, which is _different_. The second type of "programming" books usually covers a narrow range of academic knowledge, so it obviously doesn't make any sense for newcomers.

What I'm trying to do here is to build a unique resource: a book, supposed to teach you neither coding, nor algorithms, but the general thinking approach, which I personally find an absolute necessity in software engineering.
