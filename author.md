I am Ilya Kowalewski, a computer science student from Ukraine. Currently (as of summer 2015), I still have a year in school to go, so I can't really show off with my educational background, you see. I became a Google Code-in Grand Prize Winner twice, first in 2012 and later in 2014. I also did some sports programming a few years ago, though haven't made it further city contest.

Back to 2010, when I started doing some sort of coding, I faced a bunch of tricky pitfalls. First of all, I chose C++ as my first language. Still dunno what led me there, but there we go, I came to C++ land. Before I finally mastered the art of shooting myself in the foot, I had struggled for a while. Approximately, these days I moved away from Windows to KDE/Linux as my main desktop environment and started learning Qt (a cross-platform GUI application framework, written in C++).

As time went on, I had started looking into backend stacks: Python, Go. I also betrayed KDE and switched to OS X. As of summer 2015, I am developing a social service and doing some occasional pet coding, primarily in Go.

Nothing special, just yet another coding guy.
