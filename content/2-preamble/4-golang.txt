# Why I Chose Go

**NB:** This chapter explains why I chose Go as learning language for this Book. Not C++, Python, Java, Smalltalk, but Go. It requires some solid understanding of programming languages and what makes them different. A complete beginner should definitely omit this chapter.

As I mentioned inb4, software engineering is not all about coding, but coding is an essential part of it. Good news: you will actually learn some real coding, in [Go language](http://golang.org). It is, no doubts, the best language for a beginner programmer for lots of reasons. Take a look what Wikipedia says about it:

>Go, also commonly referred to as golang, is a programming language developed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a statically-typed language with syntax loosely derived from that of C, adding garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types such as variable-length arrays and key-value maps, and a large standard library.

Go is a new, but already a mature programming language with C-like syntax. It has some great features that, in my humble opinion, make it the best language for learning:

* Source code in Go is easy to read (way easier than C++/Python/Java/etc).
* Toolchain works out of the box, no object linking issues.
* Go has strict and verbose syntax (believe it or not, a heaven for beginners).
* Source code in Go works as expected (minimal amount of pitfalls).
* Garbage collector (you won't be able to mess up with memory management).
* Concurrency as part of the language (parallel programming easy as ABC).
* Huge standard library (a little less bootstrapping).

C++ is built on 85 keywords, Java consists of 50. Drumroll, Go has 25.

Grammar complexity (amount of syntactic rules) of C# is around 314, for Java it's 216. Grammar complexity of Go is 58:

Let's count the "struggle index" for most popular languages, based on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) data. According to this data, Java developers struggle x8.5 more than Go programmers:

Provided we look for an easy to learn language, Go seems like a nice choice!
