# This Book Isn't...

Since there are dozens of reasons for a one to start programming, you could appear here for a huge variety of these. Inb4 we actually advance to real learning process (programming, man!!!!), I'd like to tell you, what this book is definitely not about:

* This is NOT a manual to some specific programming language (in the end you are likely to be Intermediate in Go language though).
* This is NOT a comprehensive guide to computer science (aka algorithms).
* This is NOT a solid reference to design patterns in programming.
* After finishing this, you won't be able to hack video games, mobile apps, etc.
* This book is NOT a legitimate academic resource: it content is based on my personal experience and the view on the industry.

As I said in some previous chapter, a resource I'm building here has nothing to do with what you think programming is. They won't typically teach you this sort of things, so I take the initiative!
