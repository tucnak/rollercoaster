# Problem

Why would you want to write a computer program? Generally, you do need to write one when you face some specific problem. Otherwise it doesn't make much sense. Any software could be considered accomplished only when it solves some particular problem. Problem is a key concept, which you must take seriously in order to get the whole picture right.

People can't solve big problems as they are, so we typically split them into smaller ones. There is a clever explanation to this: problems of considerable size do usually cover a broad range of areas, technologies and responsibilities, which obviously require context switching a lot. In the meantime, we are not doing great with context switching, so it's much easier to sequentially solve smaller problems in scope of a single context.

Yet another, probably the most important, thing about problems is specification. A good problem is clear, unambiguous and has lots of details. At this point you should understand everything. Usually problems appear on some edge of "lack" and "opportunity". You ought to see the problem itself and the need in its solution. Once you do, it's fine. In case if you don't, make sure that there in fact is a problem, not an imaginary one and reach out for more specific statements.

Summing up, here is a list of things to do before doing an actual research on the problem given:

1. Make sure that problem statement is clear and unambiguous
2. Look for details carefully, there must be enough of them
3. You must understand everything well and see the roots

There we go, it's research time now!
