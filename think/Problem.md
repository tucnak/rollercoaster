# Problem

Why would you want to write a computer program? Generally, you do need to write one when you face some specific problem. Otherwise it doesn't make much sense. Any software could be considered accomplished only when it solves some particular problem. Problem is soopa doopa important concept, you must take seriously in order to get the whole picture right.

Details! Details play the key role in any problem. Problem is nothing without details. People just aren't capable of solving generic problems, since our life is *specific*. I can't really remember all the times I stepped on a rake here... Inb4 approaching the problem, make sure that it's as specific as possible.

Good problems do reflect rational needs and themself are precise enough for you to approach it properly. You can't teach anyone to tell these apart, this comes with experience. Experience in misunderstanding :)
