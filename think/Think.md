# Think!

Software engineering is not about chaotic coding and/or monkey typing. What distinguishes a good programmer from code monkeys is active implicit thinking. Good programmers always know what they do and why they do it, why code monkeys just blindly commit some actions and pray for good results. In the meantime, good engineers expect some results and later analyse them.

In this section you'll learn how to properly approach the problem, do a comprehensive research, analyse research data and implement effective solutions. In reality, it's really, supa doopa really complicated to stick to this "engineering workflow", but you must do your best here. Believe it or not, I keep on failing this part from time to time, especially when I am naive enough to think that I am already absolutely capable in doing job without a corresponding research.

I highly recommend to check out a song by Jonathan Coulton, called "Code Monkey". I have it on my playlist and listen to regularly, a great one!
