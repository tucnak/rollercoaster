# Think!

Software engineering is not about chaotic coding and monkey typing. What distinguishes a good programmer from code monkeys is thinking approach. Good programmers always know what they do, why they do it. Code monkeys commit some blind actions and pray, while an engineer expects some results and later analyses them.

In this section you'll learn how to properly approach the problem, come to clever solution, find an application for it. The whole section covers what's called "engineering workflow".
