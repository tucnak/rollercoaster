# Research

We assume that you already have got a good problem to solve, now it's time to find some ways in doing so and dig for some data required. That's where Research stage comes in — a step you should accomplish carefully, without any rush. Believe it or not, in the end, a good research can save up to 50% of work time on implemention.

### Subject area
First of all, you should define the subject area you going to work in and make sure you feel comfortable here. In fact, sometimes subject area might be kinda tough, in this case don't hesitate to explore it carefully and/or ask for help or some sort of consultation. Obviously, you have absolutely no chance to build a website without skills in front- and backend stacks or design an artificial neural network without sufficient knowledge in field of machine learning and cognitive science. You oughta follow my advice: **Don't jump into research unless you feel comfortable with the subject field; you can't basically search for unknown things, it won't make any sense!**

### Building the resource base
Once you feel comfortable in the field, outline some essentials you would most probably struggle with and focus on them during the data mining process. Struggle is always a lack of understanding, the key to sucess here is data. Once you have a sufficient amount of data, it's easier to understand things (on big datasets, you can see the same thing under different angles).

A good practice is to start with gathering resources (in fact, links to resources). No matter how you are gonna store them: browser bookmarks, saved pages, any kind of Evernote / Google Keep, it's just a matter of habit. At this stage you oughta get as much resources as possible. This could be anything: pdf specs, blog posts, stackoverflow questions, wiki, etc. If I were you, I'd emphasize on potential struggles and bottlenecks.

### Data, data everywhere
Now we assume that you've got a solid list of resources, time to check them out. Unfortunately, I can't provide a single advice on this, it's absolutely up to you: people tend to think different. In the end, you must have a fine understaning of the subject and some solid tips, you might need on the Implementation stage. Some people outline essentials, I don't. Again, it's absolutely up to you, in my humble opinion, outlines might help you to keep your intelligence structured and easy accessible.
