# Analysis

At this moment of time, we assume that you've got a comprehensive dataset of required information and sufficient knowledge in the subject field. Congratulations, you've already accomplished 2/4 (which is a half!) of our "engineering workflow". In fact, the tricky part is behind. Now, let me tell you what Analysis part is about.

### Aims and requirements
First of all, you should ask yourself a question: *"Why am I doing this?"*. There might be a couple of reasons: business, altruism, educational thing or just for fun. Each particular case would imply a different list of requirements. For some business solution, key requirement is **Time**. Business wants to get to the market as soon as possible. Business doesn't really care about the "under the hood" part, which at beginning stage could suck. There is a bold stroke that differs an efficient programmer from an inefficient one: whether you catch the deadline or not. Usually, time is the only thing that **really** matters in business. In most cases it's not an absolute truth: requirements differ from case to case.

### Managing priorities
For "pet projects" (stuff you do for fun) it's usually not about time, but quality and perfection. Since there is no manager going after your sole, there is a whole plenty of time to build a masterpiece of software engineering: code that follows all the coding guidelines, efficient algorithms and everything! On the other hand, some people prefer to hack their pet stuff really fast, by producing code that doesn't follow any coding guidelines with inefficient algorithms, some weird stuff. Well, this is absolutely up to you — pet project isn't what you do for living, it's what you do for fun. As long as it satisfies you, do it!

### Choosing programming language
Another prime point to consider is programming language and corresponding [software stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack). In case if you don't know what "software stack" is, it's basically a set of software used on some infrastructure. Choose a language that would be appropriate for your subject and you feel OK with. A few examples: Java is good for business software and huge teams, but is not effective enough in [Embedded development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_software); Python is good-looking and productive language, but not fast enough to handle highload tasks.

### Conclusion
Basically, Analysis part is all about getting missing pieces in: estimating your key values, choosing an appropriate programming language for implementation, etc. Also don't hesitate to come back to Research part if you miss some data or wanna dig into some unknown programming language.
