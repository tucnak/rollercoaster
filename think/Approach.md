# Approaching the problem

Assuming you read the previous chapter and now realize how to tell a good and a bad problem apart. This chapter is a logical follow-up, read carefully. Once you got a legitimate problem, you'd typically want to approach it. Just to clarify, in this context, "approach" is a logical sequence that leads to some solution. I can't count all the times I've stepped on a rake with this thing. I honestly don't want you to do that! I highly recommend you to ask yourself these questions every single time you approach an engineering problem.

### Can I do this on my own?

You might lack some knowledge to solve, or even approach the problem on your own. No worries, you just barely can't know everything! Don't be shy to ask for help, it's an essential part of learning. Remember, we must learn all the way along!

Problem itself might imply a complex solution. Can you really do this n your own or might need to team up? If you doubt it, I could offer you a simple technique you could use to answer this question: think of the time, in your opinion, it'd take you to get solution for the problem. Now multiply it by three-five, depending on the case. If you can afford to spend this time on solving this particular problem, it's fine â€” give it a go.
