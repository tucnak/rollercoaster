# Steady!

I keep on saying that coding is not about writing code, but understanding the code. Interesting fact: you can't really understand the code without proficient understanding of underlying mechanics, powering the code. For instance, you can't debug memory leaks without understanding of memory management concepts.

So what are we going to do in this section? First of all, I'll briefly take you through some stuff, strongly related to programming, like operating systems. Then we'll take a look at a few fundamental programming concepts, so-called paradigms. At least but not least, you'll learn most of the primitives in structural and object-oriented programming.

In fact, since this section offers all the basic things you are supposed to know in order to start some trivial coding, you could easily use it as some sort of reference. For example, don't hesitate to look back at [Function](primitives/Function.md) primitive if you feel uncomfortable with one.
