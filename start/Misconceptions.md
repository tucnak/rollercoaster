# What this book isn't about

Since there are dozens of reasons for a one to start programming, you could appear here for a huge variety of these. Inb4 we actually advance to real learning process (programming, man!!!!), I'd like to tell you, what this book is definitely not about:

* This isn't a manual to some specific programming language (in the end you are likely to be Intermediate in Go language though).
* This isn't a comprehensive guide to computer science (aka algorithms).
* This isn't a solid reference to design patterns in programming.
* After finishing this, you won't be able to hack video games, mobile apps, etc.
* This book isn't a legitimate academic resource: everything is based on my personal experience and view on the industry.

As I said in some previous chapter, resource I'm building here has nothing to do with what you think programming is. They won't typically teach you this sort of things, so I'd take the initiative!
