# Quickstart

This book is separated into 4 sequential sections. Each one represents an essential aspect of programming. First of all, I'll give you a brief introduction to the book itself, what it's not about and some specific misc information, that appears to be bloody critical.

Then you would need to learn think, get a programmers' way of thinking, which is probably, the most important part of the whole study.

The third part covers all essential technical details you need to master before doing any coding. This includes brief understanding of computer architecture, some paradigmatic knowledge and of course, programming primitives (which are rather related to programming language context).

The final, fourth part, is about to teach you real coding, design patterns, applications for some handy algorithms, object-oriented programming, concurrent/parallel programming and some basic, I'd rather say introductory, understanding of functional programming.
