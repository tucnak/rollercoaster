# Quickstart

There are multiple reasons why people come to programming: one could be excited with enormously high salaries, others could just have fun with computers. There are some common misconceptions, people somehow tend to believe.

#### You can learn programming in weeks. — No, you can't.
You can't learn programming in weeks or months, it takes years of tremendous dedication, hard work and long-term commitment. This book won't teach you what you call *coding*, it's just yet another starting point for newcomers. Some people say that programming is boring. Well, maybe. I can't deny the fact that programming has hell loads of routine, but it's totally fine for me and I think, for most software engineers.

#### Software engineers earn a lot. — Some of us do.
You should pick programming up only if you like it, only if you feel excited about coding, all the computer stuff and everything. You should not, and believe it or not, it won't end up good, start coding because of money issues. Some engineers do earn a lot, but it's not a generic rule: salaries vary a lot, especially in US. Some engineers earn $200k a year, others bump at $40k. It all depends on the area and your own skills: good programmers earn more.

#### Comprehensive knowledge in math is mandatory. — No, it's not.
Math is not mandatory for programming. There are some math essentials you can't avoid: number theory, graphs and most probably, discrete mathematics, but you won't face these everyday. In fact, math is rather seldom used in programming. There are some exciting fields for which math is vital though. For example, Machine Learning: building artificial neural networks or even doing a linear regression would require some mathematical formalism.

#### Most programmers suffer from social anxiety. — Rubbish.
We just don't. I don't know a single engineer suffering from social anxiety in person. Well, there are obviously some exceptions, but these only confirm the rule. Some people keep on saying that the only subject programmers talk about is programming, but it's not. Usually we try to avoid it in coversation, exactly like an economist would try to avoid economics talks out of the office. Ah, software engineers are not essentially experts in hardware. Believe it or not, most coders do not even track new hardware trends and have no idea "which video card is better" and "which is the best laptop".
