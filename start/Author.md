I am Ian Byrd, a computer science student and musician. As of winter 2015, I still have got a year at the high school to go, so there’s absolutely no way I could show off with any sort of educational background. That said, I became a Google Code-in Grand Prize Winner in 2012 and 2014. I also did some competitive programming a few years ago and managed to come first on the city contest a couple of times.

I started coding back to 2011 (I was a brave young 11-year old cool kid). Eventually I came to the C++ land. Still dunno what actually led me there, but I definitely had fun. Before I finally mastered (not really) the art of shooting myself in the foot, I had struggled with hundreds of specific C++ issues, nothing fun. Turns out, getting a dependency right could already be tricky enough. Apparently, I migrated away from Windows to KDE/Linux and started learning Qt these days. Making Qt-based software’s been the most bizarre experience I’ve ever had. I find myself remarkably lucky for being a part of such a vibrant community as KDE.

As time went on, I’d started looking into web backend stacks: Python, Ruby and at last, but not least, Go. As I mentioned inb4, I am a final year student at high school at the moment, so my tight academical schedule has no room for any serious coding… which is quite pity. Anyway, I do build some stuff, which you can find on my GitHub page. As a matter of fact, this page has at least three links to my GitHub profile: the one you just have seen, another one in the nav and one more on the top right corner.

Nothing special, just yet another highly talanted existentialist. Keep on readin'.
