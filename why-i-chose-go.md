# Why I chose Go for this book?
>This chapter explains why I chose Go as learning language for this Book. Not C++, Python, Java, Smalltalk, but Go. It requires some solid understanding of programming languages and differences between them. A complete beginner should definitely omit this chapter.

As I mentioned inb4, software engineering is not all about coding, but coding is an essential part of it. Good news: you will actually learn some real coding, in Go language. It is, no doubts, the best language for a beginner programmer for lots of reasons. Take a look what Wikipedia says about it:

>Go, also commonly referred to as golang, is a programming language developed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a statically-typed language with syntax loosely derived from that of C, adding garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types such as variable-length arrays and key-value maps, and a large standard library.

Go is a new, but solid programming language with C-like syntax. It has some great features that, in my opinion, make it the best language for learning:

* Source code in Go is easy to read (way easier than C++/Python/Java/etc).
* Toolchain works out of the box, no linking issues.
* Go has strict and verbose syntax (super great for beginners).
* Source code in Go works as expected (minimal amount of pitfalls).
* Garbage collector (you won't be able to mess up with memory).
* Built-in concurrency (parallel programming easy as ABC).
* Huge standard library (a little less bootstrapping).

C++ is built on 85 keywords, Java consists of 50. Go has 25 keywords.

Grammar complexity (rules count) of C# is 314, for Java it's 216. Grammar complexity of Go is 58.

Let's count the "struggle index" for most popular languages, based on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) data. According to this data, Java developers struggle x8.5 more than Go programmers:
