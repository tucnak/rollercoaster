# What this book isn't about

Since there are dozens of reasons for a one to start programming, you could appear here for a huge variety of these. Inb4 we actually advance to real learning process (programming, man!!!!), I'd like to tell you, what this book is definitely not about:

* This isn't a manual to some specific programming language, like Go.
* This isn't a comprehensive guide to computer science (aka algorithms).
* This isn't a solid reference to design patterns in programming.
* After finishing this, you won't be able to hack video games, mobile apps, etc.
* This book isn't a legitimate academic resource: everything is based on my personal experience and view on the industry.

As I said in some previous chapter, resource I'm building here has nothing to do with what you think programming is. They won't commonly teach you these things, so I take the initiative!
